The literature survey highlights Facebook as a popular social networking site, initially created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg for college students. It quickly expanded, allowing users over 13 years old with a valid email to join by 2006. Boasting over 1 billion users globally, Facebook stands out from other online communication platforms due to its unique feature of connecting and sharing with family and friends simultaneously. While various online communication methods exist, Facebook's distinctiveness lies in facilitating simultaneous connection and sharing, making it the world's largest social network.
